## 0. Project Identity

**Name:** FlowRead (final name TBD before store submission)
**Pitch:** Read everything faster. No subscription, no cloud, no account.
**What:** Privacy-first, fully offline speed reading app. PDF → high-speed reading via 4 engines. Built with Capacitor (HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS → native Android/iOS).
**Target user:** Adult readers who consume PDFs — students, researchers, professionals, self-learners.

---

## 1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1.1 100% Offline (except URL fetch in Pro)
- No backend. No cloud APIs. No analytics phoning home.
- All parsing client-side (pdf.js, mammoth.js). All data stored locally.
- Only network request in free app: Google Fonts on first load (cached forever). Will bundle fonts before launch.
- Pro URL reader: single fetch per article — labelled "requires internet" in UI.

### 1.2 No Accounts, Ever
No sign-up, login, email, password. Fully functional 1 second after first launch. Pro verified via App Store / Play Store receipt only.

### 1.3 No Subscriptions
One-time payments only. Pro and OCR Vision are lifetime. New paid features = new one-time purchases, never recurring.

### 1.4 Privacy By Architecture
Files never touch any server. We log nothing, track nothing, collect nothing. This is architecture, not a marketing claim.

### 1.5 Honest Limitations
Every limitation shown upfront in onboarding. Never silently fail. Errors explained in plain language.

## 4. Reading Engines

### RSVP
- One word at a time, fixed centre position.
- `60000/wpm` ms per word. 1.8× pause on `.!?`, 1.3× on `,;:`.
- ORP (fixation letter) at ~33%, amber `#b8995a`. **No flash animation — instant swap only.**
- Warm dark stage `#161410`. Crimson Pro 400, default 48px (24–80px range).
- Comfort controls: A−/A+, ORP toggle, Context (prev 4 words), Calm mode (dims chrome to 15%).

### Chunk Mode
- 2–7 words per flash (user-selectable, default 3). Delay = `(60000/wpm) × chunkSize`.

### Focus Bold (page-mode bionic)
- Full page of text. First 40% of each word bold. Highlight advances word-by-word at WPM.
- Pages pre-built on init (DOM measurement + word-count fallback). Playback = pure class-toggle, no DOM writes.
- Page crossfade 0.15s on page boundary. Do NOT call it "Bionic Reading" (trademarked).

### Simple Scroll (teleprompter)
- CSS `transform: translateY()` — GPU-composited, no layout reflow.
- Independent speed multiplier 0.25×–4×. Amber centre line, adjustable 1–10px.
- `pxPerMs = (wpm / 60000) × 28 / 8 × multiplier`. Delta capped 50ms.

## 5. PDF Cleaning Engine (`www/js/parser/pdf.js`)

1. Extract text with x/y positions page-by-page.
2. Group into lines by y-coordinate tolerance. Sort top→bottom, left→right.
3. Detect headers (top 14% of page, appears on 12%+ of pages) and footers (bottom 14%).
4. Strip page numbers, ISBN/ISSN/DOI lines, bare URLs, null bytes.
5. Tables → `[Table — Tap to View]` placeholder. Images → `[Image — Tap to View]`. Equations → `[Equation — Tap to View]`. Each stores its source page for Normal View jump.
6. Build `pageWordIndex[]` — array indexed by page, value = word index where page starts. Critical for bi-directional sync.

---

## 6. Bridge System

**Speed → Normal:** Floating button (bottom right) → reverse-lookup `pageWordIndex` → open Normal view at nearest page.
**Normal → Speed:** "▶ Read from here" button → `pageWordIndex[currentPage]` → switch to RSVP at that word.

---

## 7. Screen Wake Lock (`www/js/features/keep-awake.js`)

Acquire: on entering any reading view, on play. Release: on exit to home/dashboard/settings, on 5-min idle pause, on background. Never hold outside reading views.

---

## 8. UI Design System

```css
:root {
  --bg: #0d0d0d;  --surface: #141414;  --surface-2: #1c1c1c;  --border: #2a2a2a;
  --accent: #e8c547;  --accent-2: #c47a3a;
  --text: #e8e4dc;  --text-muted: #6b6660;  --text-dim: #3a3632;
  --rsvp-stage-bg: #161410;  --rsvp-orp: #b8995a;
  --success: #5a9a6a;  --error: #c45a3a;
}
```

- **No pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff) anywhere text appears.**
- Border radius 2–4px on small elements, max 6px. No pill buttons.
- Animations: 0.12–0.2s hover, 0.3s view transitions. No bounce. No RSVP flash.
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings/display), Crimson Pro (body/reading), DM Mono (labels/numbers).

## 9. Known Limitations (shown in Onboarding + Settings)

1. Scanned PDFs require OCR Vision upgrade.
2. DRM-protected files (Kindle .azw, Adobe DRM) cannot be read.
3. Multi-column PDFs (IEEE/ACM format) may have reading-order issues.
4. Tables/images shown as `[Object — Tap to View]` placeholders; some wide tables not detected.
5. Math equations skipped or shown as `[Equation — Tap to View]`.
6. Handwriting not accurately parsed even with OCR.
7. Password-protected PDFs rejected with clear error.
8. RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu) not supported in v1.
9. Pro dictionary: ~150k words; specialised terms may not be found.
10. URL reader requires internet; some sites blocked by paywalls/bot protection.

## 11. Active Phase

Phases 0–10 are complete. Current work is Phase 11.

### PHASE 11 — Share Extension & Deeper Sync

- [ ] **Task 11.1 — Widen device sync search**
  - Current: scans only DOCUMENTS and DOWNLOADS via `Filesystem.readdir`.
  - Goal: scan the entire accessible device storage. On Android, start from EXTERNAL_STORAGE root and recurse into subdirectories (Downloads, Documents, Books, Ebooks, and any user-created folders), depth-limited to 4 levels to avoid infinite loops on deeply nested trees.
  - Free tier: show only `.pdf`. Pro: also `.docx` and `.txt`.
  - Show directory path on each sync-sheet row so the user knows where the file lives.
  - Deduplicate: if the same filename appears in multiple directories, show all entries with their paths.

- [ ] **Task 11.2 — Android Share Extension (receive URL from browser)**
  - **Goal:** FlowRead appears in Android's share sheet when a user shares any URL from Chrome/Firefox/any browser. Tapping "FlowRead" in the share sheet fetches the article and saves it under Recent files. The user can tap it from Recent to start reading whenever they want — it does not auto-open the reader.
  - **Android manifest:** Add an `intent-filter` to `MainActivity` (or a lightweight trampoline `Activity`) for `ACTION_SEND` with `text/plain` MIME type. Extract the URL from `getIntent().getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT)` when the activity starts.
  - **Capacitor bridge:** Implement a minimal custom Capacitor plugin (or use `@capacitor/app`'s `appUrlOpen` listener) to forward the shared URL string from the Android layer to the JS layer when the app is foregrounded via the share intent.
  - **JS handler (`www/js/features/share-handler.js`):** On receiving a shared URL — validate with `validateArticleUrl()`, run `fetchReadableArticle()`, call `saveFileData()` + `saveFileToLibrary()`, then `renderLibrary()` to refresh Recent, show toast "Article saved to Recent files."
  - **Pro gate:** If user is not Pro when the share intent fires, show the paywall and do not fetch.
  - **iOS:** iOS Share Extension is a separate app target. Plan for v1.2, not this phase.

- [ ] **Task 11.3 — Error boundary**
  - Wrap all parser calls and engine init in a top-level try/catch in `app.js`.
  - Any unhandled error: show a plain-language error card ("Something went wrong — please re-import the file") and return user to home. Never a blank screen or silent crash.

## 12. Code Rules

### Architecture
- **Vanilla JS only.** No React, Vue, Svelte, Alpine, no build step.
- **No external runtime dependencies** beyond pdf.js, mammoth.js, and Capacitor plugins in Section 2.
- **No npm utility packages** (no lodash, moment, date-fns). Write what you need.
- **No CSS frameworks** (no Tailwind, Bootstrap).

### Storage
- **Never localStorage for purchase state.** Always Capacitor Preferences.
- localStorage fine for: position, WPM, theme, UI state.
- All keys prefixed `fr_`.

### Performance
- No layout thrashing during playback. Word stage must repaint at 600+ WPM (~100ms).
- Lazy-render PDF canvas pages.
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll animation.
- Build spans once; manipulate classes during playback.

### UX
- **Reading position is sacred.** Every navigation must call `savePosition()`.
- Never more than one modal at a time.
- Always show loading state for operations over 200ms.
- Never show raw exception text to user.

### Style
- Functions: verbs (`renderUpload`, `acquireWakeLock`). State: nouns (`words`, `index`).
- Files single-purpose. Comments explain *why* not *what*.

### When to stop and ask
- Before any new dependency.
- Before changing palette or typography.
- Before adding any new file format.
- Before changing pricing.
- Before adding features not listed here.

## 13. Communication Protocol

At session start: acknowledge reading AGENTS.md and state the current task. Before starting: briefly state the plan. After completing: mark done, ask if user wants to test or move on. If ambiguous: ask, don't guess. If something breaks: show the actual error, explain the cause, propose the fix. Never silently introduce features not listed here.

---

## 14. Project Status

- **Current phase:** Phase 11 — Share Extension & Deeper Sync
- **Target platforms:** Android first, iOS second.
- **Target launch:** TBD — quality over speed.

*This document is the contract. Update it before changing direction, not after.*
